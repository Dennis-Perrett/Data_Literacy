# Data Literacy Project

--- 
Main work is done inside the ipython notebook. Other files are support files.

The R file is for comparison. Some libraries/packages are ported from R to Python - specifically Semopy. In some cases, linear algebra errors occur in Semopy. To confirm whether this is an issue with the model structure or with the package, the same model was run in Lavaan (far more robust).
